            <h1>Hi, I'm Ethan</h1>
            <p>Originally from Toronto, I made my way to UC San Diego where I’m studying Human-Computer Interaction hoping to become a Product Designer one day!





Growing up, Hockey was my number one sport. Its where I got to hone my creativity and learn how to work together as a team. 





I’ve always been creative at heart whether it was making videos for school assemblies or designing graphics for school events, I’ve always made sure to find a way to feed my creative fix. 





As a Product designer, I hope to help shape the future by allowing people to achieve their dreams and feed their passions through my designs.</p>
